This was written using the Code::Blocks IDE. The project files are included, except for the ToadOS.depend file.
If you plan to use the same IDE, make sure to install Allegro 5 and add it to the Project dependencies.

DEPENDENCIES: Allegro 5.x 
	Allegro homepage: https://liballeg.org/download.html


NOTE: This project was designed to be cross-platform, but it was intended for Windows machines and as such was 
not tested on anything else. Remember too, that this is in the early stages of development and I haven't worked on it in quite some time.
